# Image-segmentation
Image segmentation on Lower Glioma Cases in MRI

# Description
The goal of the project is to predict masks with the use of a large image dataset which includes 
masks for the patients who have some kind of glioma tumours.
In more detail that means that the model that the team creates will need to predict masks for the 
patients MRI images similar to the ones that pre-exist in order to be a good prediction.
The whole project is based on MRI images, the use of Machine Learning and the possibility to use 
data to teach the model to differentiate between normal brain images and images containing tumours.
